## About
The need to create the component came from a study project which i was using this technologies/languages, so i needed a select that would be integrated with **Livewire** and could be reused anywhere, as many times as needed.

## Preview
<img width="580" src="./previews/closed.png" alt="Preveiw dropdown closed" />
<img width="580" src="./previews/opened.png" alt="Preview dropdown opened" />

## How to use
I tried to leave the project in the same structure in which it was used for easy understanding, follow the steps:
```
1. Download files
2. Paste the files into your project using the same folder structure
3. Don't forget to replace/remove the variables inside the files (app/Views/Components/Select.php) and (views/select/*)
4. Done
```
